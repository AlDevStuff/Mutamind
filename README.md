# Instruction
1. Clone Mutamind repository on your bash
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AlDevStuff/Mutamind.git
```
2. Then run nucleotide.py 
```bash
python nucleotide.py
```
3. Insert one of the mentioned Gene HBB or HBA1 (HTT and F8 is available on high-end computer since the genetic sequence is long) and insert the entire sequence related to that gene found in test.py.
<br />
NOTE: **ALL GENE MUST BE CAPITALIZED**
